# N-Grams models Tool

Welcome to the N-Grams models Tool! This open-source project is designed for creating, fine-tuning, and utilizing N-Grams models. It is a comprehensive, web-based tool that consolidates all the necessary functionalities for N-Grams models in one place, making it ideal for students and researchers.

## Features

- **Create and Fine-tune N-Grams Models**: Easily build N-Grams models from your own datasets.
- **Use N-Grams Models in Chatbots**: Integrate N-Grams models into chatbot applications to explore their effectiveness.
- **Local Deployment**: Run the tool locally to ensure privacy and security of your data.
- **Educational Resource**: Learn how N-Grams work and apply them in your projects.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with AdminLTE, the tool provides an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   git clone https://github.com/AlhusainAliAlharthi/create-fine-tuning-use-N-Grams-models.git

   cd create-fine-tuning-use-N-Grams-models

3. **Open in Browser**

   Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the tool.

## Usage

1. **First Screen**

   If you open this tool, you will see a chat interface in the middle where you can interact with the default model. You can edit the generation settings from the box on the left, and from the box on the right, you can upload your models. Then, you must click on the button with the name of your model to use it.

2. **Creating Models**

   To create a model, you have to click on the 'Model' tab and then the 'New' button. You will see two cards: one on the left for creating settings, and one in the middle for writing your training text.

3. **Fine-tuning Models**

   If you want to add new text to your previous models, you can click on the 'Model' tab and then the 'Update' button. You will see two cards: the one on the left for settings, but some fields, like name and number of grams, will be disabled as they are loaded from the model when you upload it. In the middle card, the upper section is for uploading the model, and the lower section is for writing new text.

## Educational Insights

Throughout the project, you will find explanations and insights into how N-Grams models work, how to tokenize text, and how to apply these models in practical scenarios. This will help you answer questions like:

- "How can I use N-Grams in a chatbot?"
- "Do N-Grams work well in chatbots?"
- "How do I tokenize text for N-Grams models?"
